Welcome to our clickbait chrome extension

We're two developers that were tired of falling for clickbait news articles on Facebook, Youtube, and news outlets.

We decided to create a chrome extension that would detect if the current article is clickabait
based on ml model we created that was trained on many clickbait news titles.

Currently we are still developing the extension, but to see the backend model in action see below!

To run this application on the command line locally:
-Install this repo locally
-Install python3, numpy, sklearn (can use pip install for all these packages)
-Run the interactive.py file (python3 interactive.py) on the command line
-Wait for ~15-20 secs as the model trains then enter an article title and press enter
    (ex. "10 ways your astrological symbol dicates your life's meaning!")
-Watch as the model classifies the article as clickbait or news
-to quit press q, quit, ctr^c
